## ⚠️ CONCERNS - What Could Hinder Adoption

### 1. **Enterprise Features "Coming Soon"** ⚠️⚠️⚠️
**Issue:** Enterprise plan ($99/month) has 4 features marked "Coming Soon":
- API access
- White-label option
- Custom integrations
- Custom branding

**Impact:**
- ❌ Enterprise customers won't pay $99/month for incomplete features
- ❌ Risk of customer complaints/refunds
- ❌ Hurts credibility

**Recommendation:** 
- **Option A:** Remove Enterprise plan until features are ready
- **Option B:** Lower Enterprise price to $49/month with clear "Early Access" messaging
- **Option C:** Implement at least 2 of these features before launch

**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH

### 2. **AI Insights Quality Unknown** ⚠️⚠️
**Issue:** 
- AI insights depend on OpenAI API (optional)
- Fallback to rule-based insights if API fails
- Quality of insights not verified

**Impact:**
- ❌ If AI insights are generic/poor quality, customers won't see value
- ❌ Could hurt Pro plan adoption (AI insights are a key feature)

**Recommendation:**
- Test AI insights with real customer data
- Ensure fallback insights are still valuable
- Consider adding "AI Insight Quality" to roadmap

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

### 3. **Limited Data Sources** ⚠️
**Issue:**
- Only CSV/Excel upload
- No database connections
- No API integrations
- No cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)

**Impact:**
- ❌ Enterprise customers need database connections
- ❌ Power users want API integrations
- ❌ Limits use cases

**Recommendation:**
- Add to roadmap for v2.0
- For now, focus on CSV/Excel (covers 80% of use cases)

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW (for initial launch)

### 4. **No Collaboration Features** ⚠️
**Issue:**
- No team sharing
- No comments/annotations
- No version history
- Shareable links exist but no collaboration

**Impact:**
- ❌ Teams can't collaborate on dashboards
- ❌ Limits Enterprise adoption
- ❌ Reduces stickiness

**Recommendation:**
- Add to roadmap
- Shareable links are a good start

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM (for growth phase)

### 5. **Limited Chart Customization** ⚠️
**Issue:**
- Auto-generated charts (good for simplicity)
- Limited customization options
- Can't change colors, styles, layouts

**Impact:**
- ❌ Power users might want more control
- ❌ Branding limitations

**Recommendation:**
- This is actually a **strength** for target market (non-technical users)
- Keep it simple, but add basic customization in future

**Priority:** 🟢 LOW
