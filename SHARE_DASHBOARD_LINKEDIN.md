## 📝 LinkedIn Post Template

Here's a formatted version of Cruz Corral's post with your dashboard link:

**How much I've made from 5 years of content creation 💰:**

2020: $0
2021: $1,200
2022: $5,600
2023: $63,000
2024: $554,000
2025: $930,000 (and still climbing)

I'm sharing this because transparency matters especially in a space where most people only see the highlight reel. I spent years wondering if I was "doing it right," comparing myself to other creators who seemed to be miles ahead, and having no clue what the actual earning journey looked like.

So this isn't a flex, it's to show and hopefully inspire other creators right now because many of the ones I followed didn't share this on the way up.

It's a reminder that growth can be slow, messy, and then suddenly…exponential. It's a reminder that if you stay consistent even when the numbers aren't great, that money will follow.

Somewhere along the way, it clicked for me and I realized there's room for EVERYONE and you're NEVER too late.

If you're creating something right now, just keep going.

You have no idea what next year could look like!!

And hey, I guess I'm not that same broke millennial anymore. 🥲

## 💡 Pro Tips:

1. **Add Visual Appeal**: Export the pie chart or time series view as an image and attach it to your LinkedIn post
2. **Call to Action**: Encourage others to try the tool with their own data
3. **Tag Relevant People**: Tag other content creators who might find this useful
4. **Use Hashtags**: 
   - #ContentCreator
   - #DataAnalytics
   - #BusinessGrowth
   - #Entrepreneurship
   - #DataVisualization
   - #CreatorEconomy

## 🎯 Alternative: Create a Visual Post

Instead of just sharing the link, you could:

1. Export the dashboard as PDF
2. Take a screenshot of the pie chart showing income distribution
3. Post the image on LinkedIn with the comment
4. Include the dashboard link in the comments or as a follow-up post

This approach often gets more engagement!

**Note**: The shareable link works best when shared with people who can access your browser's localStorage, or you can use the backend sharing feature if you've saved the dashboard to the database.
