## 🔍 If You Want to Remove It

   - Look for "Analytics" or "Insights" settings
   - Disable if found

2. **Check if it's in your code:**
   - Search for "cloudflare" or "beacon" in your codebase
   - Remove if found (but I didn't see it in your code)

3. **It might be added automatically by Amplify** - you can't control this
