# Maritime vessel map icons

Free maritime-style icons used for vessel types on the map (tanker, cargo, passenger, fishing, tug, sail, pleasure, default).

**Attribution:** These icons are provided for use in NM2 Analytics Shorts. For more maritime and transport icons, see [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons/set/ship) (free with attribution).

You can replace any SVG in this folder with icons from Icons8 or other sources; keep the same filenames (`tanker.svg`, `cargo.svg`, etc.) so the map continues to work.
