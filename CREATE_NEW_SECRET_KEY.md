# 🔑 Create a New Stripe Secret Key

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Go to Stripe Dashboard → API Keys (Live Mode)**
   - Make sure you're in **Live mode** (toggle in top right)

2. **Click "+ Create secret key"** (top right button)

3. **Name the key:**
   - Enter a name like: `Production Key` or `Analytics App Production`
   - Click **"Create secret key"**

4. **⚠️ CRITICAL: Copy the key immediately!**
   - Stripe will show you the complete key **ONLY ONCE**
   - It will look like: `sk_live_51RilIPCAL4InIKRQ...very_long_string...`
   - **Copy the entire key** (should be ~100+ characters)

5. **Save it somewhere safe:**
   - Paste it in a text file temporarily
   - Or share it with me so I can help you update your config

6. **Click "Done"** after copying

## After You Have the Key

Once you have the new secret key, I'll help you:
- Update `backend/.env` with the new key
- Test the configuration
- Set up the webhook (if needed)

**Go ahead and create the new key, then share it with me!** 🚀
