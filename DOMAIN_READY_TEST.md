   ```bash
   ipconfig /flushdns
   ```

2. **Close all browser windows completely**

   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Time range: "All time"
   - Clear data

## ✅ Step 2: Test in Incognito Mode

**Test in a fresh browser session:**

1. **Press** `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Chrome) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Firefox)
2. **Visit:** `https://analytics-shorts.nm2tech-sas.com`

## ✅ Step 3: Test Directly

**Try accessing the domain:**

## ✅ Step 4: If Still Not Working

**If you still get errors:**

1. **Try HTTP first:** `http://analytics-shorts.nm2tech-sas.com`
   - **If HTTP works:** SSL might need a few more minutes
   - **If HTTP doesn't work:** Check CloudFront configuration

2. **Wait 2-3 more minutes** for CloudFront to fully deploy

3. **Check browser console** (F12) for any errors
