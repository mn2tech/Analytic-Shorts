# ⏳ SSL Certificate in Progress

## ✅ SSL Certificate Being Created

Amplify is currently issuing an SSL certificate for `analytics-shorts.nm2tech-sas.com`. This is normal and expected!

---

## ⏳ What's Happening

1. **Amplify is requesting** SSL certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
2. **DNS validation** is being performed
3. **Certificate is being issued** (takes 5-10 minutes typically)

---

## ✅ What to Do

### Just Wait!

1. **Wait** 5-10 minutes
2. **Don't refresh** the page constantly (it will update automatically)
3. **Status will change** from "SSL creation in progress" to "Available" when ready

---

## ✅ After SSL is Ready

**Once the status shows "Available":**

1. **Visit:** `https://analytics-shorts.nm2tech-sas.com`
2. **Should show** Analytics Shorts app ✅
3. **SSL certificate** working (green lock icon) ✅
4. **All assets** load correctly ✅

---

## 🔍 If It Takes Longer

**If SSL takes more than 10-15 minutes:**

1. **Check** the domain status
2. **Look for** any error messages
3. **Check** Route 53 DNS records (if Amplify shows instructions)
4. **Verify** DNS propagation

**Usually it completes within 5-10 minutes though!**
