# Find Price ID - Click on the Price Row

## 🎯 What to Do

I can see your Stripe product page! The Price ID is there, but you need to click to reveal it.

### Method 1: Click the Price Row (Easiest)

1. In the **Pricing** section, you'll see a row showing:
   - "$29.00 USD" 
   - "Default" badge
   - "0 active"
   - "Dec 4"
   - Ellipsis icon (⋯)

2. **Click directly on that price row** (the entire row, not just the ellipsis)

3. The price details should expand or open, showing:
   - The **Price ID** (starts with `price_`)
   - It will look like: `price_1ABC123def456ghi789`

4. **Copy the Price ID** (there should be a copy icon next to it)

### Method 2: Click the Ellipsis Menu

1. Click the **ellipsis icon (⋯)** at the end of the price row
2. A dropdown menu should appear
3. Look for an option like "View details" or "Copy Price ID"
4. Click it to see/copy the Price ID

### Method 3: Edit the Price

1. Click the **ellipsis (⋯)** on the price row
2. Select **"Edit price"** or **"View price"**
3. The Price ID should be visible on the price details page

## 📋 What the Price ID Looks Like

Once you click and reveal it, you'll see something like:

```
Price ID: price_1QwErTyUiOpAsDfGhJkLzXcVbNm
[📋 Copy]
```

It will:
- Start with `price_` (not `prod_`)
- Be much longer than the Product ID
- Have a copy button next to it

## ✅ Quick Steps

1. **Click the price row** in the Pricing table
2. **Look for "Price ID"** in the expanded view
3. **Copy it** (starts with `price_`)
4. **Paste it here** and I'll help you add it!
