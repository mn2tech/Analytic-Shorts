## 🎯 My Recommendation

**For speed:** Skip the image now, create the product, get the Price ID. You can add the image later by editing the product.

**If you want an image:** Use Option 2 (convert SVG to PNG) - it's quick and uses your existing branding.

**Remember:** The image is optional! The important thing is getting the Price ID! 🚀
